# PSO
Particle Swarm Optimizer
The function implements a Particle Swarm Optimizer, along with four Neighborhood Topologies: Global, Ring, Random, and 
von Nuemann. Additionally three n-dimesnional benchmark functions have also been programed that allow you to run 
the optimizer on a search for a global minimum.
